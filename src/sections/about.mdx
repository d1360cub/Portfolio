## About

> Father, husband, engineer, student, mentor, problem solver...

More than fifteen years of experience as an engineer, working in different industries and job positions. For the last seven years I have gone through Controls (Field) Engineer to run a countrywide company, making short stops as a project manager and key account manager.

I believe that biggest challenges are outside of our comfort zone, so right now I am pivoting my career and I want to face technology from software development. It is well know that software is changing all the time so we have to learn really quick in order to keep up, which is, per se, a great challenge.
